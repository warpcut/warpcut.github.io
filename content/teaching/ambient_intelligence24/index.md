**Abstract**: The continuous and rapid development of sophisticated sensing devices and advanced AI methods makes it possible to realize intelligent environments that unobtrusively support people in their daily life. Such systems may operate indoors (e.g., smart homes, smart buildings) as well as outdoors (e.g., smart cities). The aim of this course is to teach how to design and implement intelligent systems in such Ambient Intelligence scenarios, considering both technological and methodological aspects.
