abstract: "Musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK-US) is a non-invasive and easily accessible diagnostic tool for joint health assessment of patients with hemophilia. The early identification of hemarthrosis is pivotal and could be achieved by a telemedicine system where MSK-US is performed by general practitioners or the patients themselves. The images so collected could be sent to the Comprehensive Care Center clinicians. Due to the great number of images collected, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the automatic detection of joint effusion could support the physicians in prioritizing interventions."
